; Lists

; list primitives
;empty
;--- a special value, mostly to represent the empty list
;empty?
;--- a predicate to recognize empty and nothing else
;first
;--- the selector to extract the first item
;rest
;--- the selector to extract all but the first item

;an empty list is simply written as 
;empty
;'()
;(list)
; vs
;(list empty)

; higher order procedures
; filter, ormap, andmap, map, foldl, foldr

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;Lists

;'() is a shorthand
;notation for (list...)

;so '(1 2 3) is the same as
;(list 1 2 3)
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


;Let's say that we define the lists below:

(define lst1
  (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))

(define lst2
  (list 9 (list 10 11)))

;QUESTION 1A
;What does (* (first (rest lst1)) (first (first (rest lst2))))
;return?

;Answer: 

;QUESTION 1B
;What does (length lst2)
;return?

;Answer: 

;QUESTION 1C
;What does (rest lst2)
;return?

;Answer: 


;QUESTION 2
;Write a procedure called two-to-five, that takes one input,
; a non-empty list containing numbers only and returns true
; if there are at least three numbers in lst that are between
; 2 (inclusive) and 5 (inclusive), false otherwise.
; Use filter in your definition.

;two-to-five: (listof Number) -> Boolean
;Takes in a non-empty list containing numbers only and returns true
; if there are at least three numbers in lst that are between
; 2 (inclusive) and 5 (inclusive), false otherwise.
;(define (two-to-five lst)
;  ...)

;(check-expect (two-to-five (list 1 2 3 4 5))
;              true)
;(check-expect (two-to-five (list 0 6 7 8))
;              false)

;QUESTION 3
;Write a procedure called squared-threes that takes in
; one input, a non-empty list of numbers. It extracts all
; numbers from the list that are divisible by 3, and then
; returns a list of these numbers squared. 

;(define (squared-threes lst)
;  ...)

;(check-expect (squared-threes (list 1 2 10 8 9))
;              (list 81))
;(check-expect (squared-threes (list 6 3 5 10 12 19))
;              (list 36 9 144))
